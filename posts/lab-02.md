In this lab, we will walk through the process of setting up the Unity game engine and Visual Studio Code for Mixed Reality development.

1. **Install Unity Hub:** First, download and install Unity Hub from the official Unity website. Unity Hub is the management tool for all your Unity projects and editor versions.

2. **Install Visual Studio Code:** We use Visual Studio Code as our code editor. Download it and ensure you install the "C# Dev Kit" or "C#" extension to enable IntelliSense and debugging features.

3. **Create a New Project:** Open Unity Hub, navigate to the "Projects" tab, and click "New Project". Select the "3D Core" template to start with a clean 3D environment suitable for MR.

4. **Project Configuration:** Name your project (e.g., `MR_Lab2`) and choose a location on your drive. Click "Create Project" and wait for the Unity Editor to initialize.
